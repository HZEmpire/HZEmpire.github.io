<h2>Building a Real-Time Weather Portal for Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Hong Kong's weather can be unpredictable—typhoons, sudden rainstorms, and rapid temperature shifts are all part of life here. I wanted to create a tool that goes beyond simple forecasts, offering real-time meteorological insights in an accessible and visually engaging format.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Live weather updates.</strong> Real-time data from Hong Kong Observatory API, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall measurements.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive visualizations.</strong> Dynamic charts and maps that help users understand weather patterns at a glance.</li>
  <li><strong>Typhoon tracking.</strong> Special alerts and tracking information during severe weather events.</li>
  <li><strong>7-day forecast.</strong> Detailed predictions with hourly breakdowns to help plan ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
<p>The application is built with vanilla JavaScript and leverages the Hong Kong Observatory's public API for data retrieval. I focused on creating a lightweight, responsive interface that works seamlessly across devices—from desktop monitors to mobile phones.</p>

<p>One of the interesting challenges was handling the Observatory's data format, which sometimes includes mixed Chinese and English content. I implemented a parsing layer that normalizes this information and presents it consistently to users.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>Weather information should be instantly readable. I opted for a clean, minimalist design with clear typography and intuitive icons. The color scheme adapts based on current conditions—bright blues for clear skies, deeper grays for overcast weather, and warm oranges for alerts.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>I'm planning to add historical data comparisons, air quality integration, and personalized notification settings. There's also potential to incorporate machine learning for more accurate local predictions based on historical patterns.</p>

  Good design is invisible. The weather app should feel like looking out the window, just more informative.
